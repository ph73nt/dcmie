# dcmie
This package contains a set of plugins for the ImageJ framework (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) to import and export DICOM images.

* Dcm_Import: This plugin imports DICOM compatible images to ImageJ. 
*	Dcm_Export: This plugin exports all ImagesJ images (besides 32-bit float) as DICOM Secondary Capture images.
*	Dcm_PropertyLister: This plugin lists the properties assigned to an ImageJ image.
*	Dcm_Inspector: This is a plugin and a stand-alone program. Its purpose is to look inside a DICOM image. It also allows to convert a DICOM image to a XML representation and to process that by a XSL processor. 
In contrast to the ImageJ  build-in DICOM functionality it is possible to read and write to the local filesystem and to DICOM file-sets, i.e. a DICOMDIR. That means, that for example DICOM CDâ€™s may be read and written. As an option the imported images may contain all the DICOM metadata either as Java property-strings and/or binary data. These metadata can be used by other plugins for image calculation.
